  "bio": "His debut short, *Rats* (2013), screened at film festivals and markets in Toronto, Montréal, Atlanta, New York City and Clermont-Ferrand. The film garnered praise for its lush black & white photography shot on Super 16mm.\n\nIn 2023, Jonathan created his own indie production company, Productions Mauvais Oeil, with his partner and collaborator Sal Eigh. His upcoming short, *Bad Dreams*, will be his first effort under this new venture. Inspired by his experience living in mixed-income housing in Toronto, *Bad Dreams* portrays a fictional building in a neighbourhood undergoing gentrification through the eyes of its quirky residents.\n\nIn between both of these films, Jonathan has been honing his craft directing music videos and working in Canadian public television, making trailers and documentary programming.\n\nHe is now developing his next picture, *Le Roi des crabes*, a French-language coming-of-age tale set in a coastal town in southern France.\n\nJonathan currently resides in Montréal.",
